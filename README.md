# C-SharpDB

MS SQL

The course focuses heavily on the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental performance tuning is provided. This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and to understand concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).

Entity Framework Core

The course follows in detail the work with the ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model through "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations.
